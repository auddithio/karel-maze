## Project description

Short description of the basic idea and end goal you are aiming for:
Karel is a teaching tool for students who are taking their first computer science course. Students learn to instruct Karel to move in its 2D virtual world with just 4 commands: move(), turn\_left(), pick\_beeper(), and put\_beeper(). One struggle many students have is visualizing how to move and turn Karel. Our goal is to create a 3D Karel world that will help students better visualize how Karel will respond to their commands. 

Ideally, the project will have the following components: 
- A physical world representing Karel's x-y grid that Karel can move in. We are thinking of creating the grid with laser cutting or a 3D printer.
- A physical Karel that can move forward and turn left. We are thinking of implementing Karel's movements with a plotter mechanism (similar to draw bot) that can move in the x-y direction. The draw bot would control a magnet that our Karel figure is attached to. 
- A shell console where a user can type in commands for Karel

Our stretch goals are: 
- implementing put\_beeper() and pick\_beeper() functions
- implenting obstacles (walls) in Karel's world

Our fallback position is: 
- just writing code to make Karel move a fixed distance
- just including our console


## Hardware, budget
Itemize what hardware, if any, you need and your plan for acquiring it.
Rough budget for the project. Remember we will reimburse you up to $20 per person.

- Stepper motors and rotational motor to implement the draw bot 
- Lab space for laser cutting or 3D printing the board and Karel
- Magnets for Karel's base
- Material for Karel's world (plastic/metal/wood) 

We plan to visit Lab 64 on Friday 3/4 to see what items are available there. 

## Major tasks, member responsibilities
1. Build draw plot to move Karel 
2. Build Karel's world 
3. Implement code & mechanics to make Karel move 
4. Implement code & mechanics to make Karel turn 
5. Add the commands move() and turn\_left() to our Shell console

We may seek an additional team member from 107E to join us.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
What are the one-week goals you plan to meet for next week?

By Wed 3/9:
1. Construct a draw plot that will allow Karel to move (hardware)
2. Implement the code to make Karel move (software)
3. Construct the board and Karel's figure (setup)
4. Combine above components (hardware, software, setup) to make Karel move

## Resources needed, issues
Are there books/code/tools/materials that you need access to? 
What are the possible risks to overcome? What are you concerned about? 
How can we help you succeed?

- Access to Lab64 would be great! 
- If there is existing hardware to implementing the draw plot, that would be extremely helpful 
- Help with laser cutter to make Karel's world
- 3D printer or laser cutter to make Karel
- Advice on how to build interface between our code on console and our hardware to make Karel move

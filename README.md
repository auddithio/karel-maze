Karel's CS107E Adventure

## Team members
Auddithio Nag and Patricia Wei

## Project description
Our project celebrates the beloved Karel from CS 106A and the joy of learning
computer science. In the Karel CS 107E Adventure, players pretend to be Karel and
find a beeper in the maze. By moving or turning left, they can see Karel follow
their movements on the screen. They may also come across some lovely surprises,
like bumping into our wonderful professors Julie Zelenski and Pat Hanrahan.

## Member contribution
Patricia: soldered wires for accelerometer/gyroscope to attach to the body, 
created bitmaps for images and code to process them (in gl.c), 
created welcome/resume/end screen (in board.c), wrote code to implement the flow of the game (game.c) 

Auddithio: wrote code to process data from accelerometer/gyroscope and translate
them into moves for Karel (accel.c), created board and maze for Karel (board.c),
wrote code to update Karel's moves based on data from sensor (karel_world.c), added timer for game (game.c)

## References
We would like to thank Pat Hanrahan for his implementation of the LSM6DS33 driver,
which we used in our project. We would like to thank our classmate Ben Ruland for
inspiring us with some of his image processing code.
